    "## ICU stay: predicting length-of-stay (LOS) with characteristics at admission\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) is a frequent measure of ICU **resource use** and **performance** [1]. Predictions of ICU LOS are routinely used as the means of resource allocation because patients with prolonged ICU LOS account for a large proportion of resource use [2], and the early identification of the patients may help in future **planning**, such as determining discharge alternatives (e.g. long-term acute care facilities) or making sure the receiving ward after stabilization has enough available beds at the time of discharge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, prediction of ICU LOS is difficult and less studied than the prediction of mortality [3]. Prolonged stay in ICU not only **increases the overall costs** and **consumes more resources**, but also **limits the number of beds** available for use. In addition, patients, families, physicians and managers demand more informed health care information. In addition, predictive ICU models could be a building block in the larger process of making _do not resuscitate_ (DNR) decisions to determine whether to stop patient therapy to avoid unnecessary suffering and treatment costs [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to predict LOS as an **initial assessment** of patients’ risk is therefore critical for better **resource planning and allocation**, especially when the resources are limited, as in ICUs, and can also facilitate management with **higher flexibility in hospital bed use** and better assessment in the **cost-effectiveness treatment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we believe ICU LOS to be a **very valuable key performance indicator (KPI)**, pertinent in all the critical hospital management fields mentioned above. The goal of this challenge is to predict ICU LOS with the help of patients' characteristics at admission in ICU. All data has been queried from the MIMIC-III database [4], an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with ~40,000 critical care patients."
